# 🏛️ White House Visitor Logs: Data Analysis & Visualization

**Author**: Cheri Beda  
**Project Type**: Python Data Analysis & Visualization  
**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores publicly available White House Visitor Logs to uncover trends in visits over time, most-used meeting locations, 
and patterns in weekday activity. The objective is to demonstrate practical data visualization and analysis skills using real-world government data.

## 🚀 Features
- Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Aggregation by date, year, and location
  - Multiple chart types: bar, line, pie, and stacked bar
- Visual storytelling using Gestalt principles
- Highlights:
  - Peak visit periods and days of the week
  - Top meeting locations (WH, OEOB, NEOB)
  - Visitor type distribution
